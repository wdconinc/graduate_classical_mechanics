\paragraph*{Small Oscillations}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Consider two identical harmonic oscillators of mass $m$ and frequency $\omega_0$ that are coupled by the interaction potential $V_{int} = -\alpha q_1 q_2$.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Determine the normal-mode frequencies and eigenvectors.
  \item Determine the frequencies and discuss their superposition when $\alpha \ll \omega_0^2$.
 \end{itemize}
 \item Fetter \& Walecka, Problem 4.3.
 \item Fetter \& Walecka, Problem 4.9, (a).
 \item A charged particle of mass $m$ and charge $+e$ is restricted to move in the $xy$ plane.  It moves under the influence of two fixed charges $q_1$ located at $\pm a \hat{x}$ and two other charges $q_2$ at $\pm a \hat{y}$.  Show that the origin is a point of equilibrium.  Under which conditions is the origin a point of \emph{stable} equilibrium?  For a stable equilibrium, find the frequencies and normal modes of the small oscillations around the origin.
\end{itemize}
